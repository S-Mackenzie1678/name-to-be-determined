# This is a project to create a video game by students of Dawnwood Middle School and people they have asked for assistance. Our code is mostly in Ruby 2.5.0 or the latest update should any come out. 

We use labels to tell what our PRs and Issues are and need. All issues and PRs should have one of the priority labels. They should also have any applicable labels, too.

If we ever need to use an enum-like construct, we will use a class whit just those variables numbered 1 - x.
